Hello! My name is Dasha. I graduated Belarusian State Economic University in 2016. Then I was working as a supply manager for 2 years. And now I'm learning Java Script to work as a frontend programmer.
I always interested in technologies, new experience, Universe, robots... but now I'm here, with my economist diploma, trying to learn new skill. For me programming is a chance to make my dreams come true, to feel myself useful, to be part of global community. 

My personal strenghs are:

* aspiration to learn new skills
* teamwork
* punctuality
* flexibility
